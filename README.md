# Kineton Theory

**Kineton Theory** is a structural framework for fundamental physics that proposes a new ontological basis for mass, motion, and time. Instead of relying on a predefined spacetime background, it suggests that all physical phenomena emerge from the rhythmic interactions of massless, light-speed oscillatory units called **kinetons**.

## ðŸŒŒ Core Idea

- All particles with mass are composed of fundamental **massless kinetons**.
- Kinetons always propagate at the speed of light.
- Time, motion, and space emerge from the **structural rhythm mappings** between kineton configurations.

## ðŸ§­ Goals

- Replace spacetime with a **background-free** structure of rhythmic interactions.
- Provide an alternative route to recover and reinterpret **relativity**.
- Lay a foundation for a unified framework that bridges quantum and gravitational phenomena.
