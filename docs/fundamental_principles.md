# Fundamental Principles of Kineton Theory

Kineton Theory rests upon a set of foundational postulates that redefine key physical concepts from a structural and relational perspective.

---

## 1. Structural Ontology

- The fundamental entities of physical reality are massless oscillatory units called **kinetons**.
- Kinetons always propagate at the speed of light and interact only through structured rhythmic configurations.

---

## 2. Emergence of Time

- Time is not a universal background but a **structural ordering** of rhythmic interactions between kinetons.
- The sequence of events arises from coherent mappings, not from external flow.

---

## 3. Structural Definition of Motion

- Motion is defined as the **mapping ratio** between rhythmic densities across reference structures:
  
  \[
  v = \frac{\rho_A}{\rho_B}
  \]
  
- There is no absolute velocity—only structural relationships.

---

## 4. Rhythmic Density Tensor

- Introduces a geometric object $\rho_{\mu\nu}$ encoding field-like effects (acceleration, gravitation) via structural deformation of rhythmic patterns.
- Dynamics emerge from the intrinsic behavior of this tensorial structure.

---

## 5. Structural Relativity Principle

> All physical laws are invariant under transformations between reference structures related by rhythmic mappings. There is no absolute motion, no absolute rhythm, and no absolute time—only the structure of transformations.

---

## 6. No Fundamental Background

- Spacetime, scale, and locality are **emergent**, not fundamental.
- There is no smallest unit of space or time—only relatively structured densities.
