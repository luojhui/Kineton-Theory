# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) – Kineton Theory

This document addresses common questions about Kineton Theory, its principles, and implications. As a developing theoretical framework, this FAQ evolves with the theory.

---

## ❓ What is a kineton?
A **kineton** is the fundamental oscillatory unit proposed by Kineton Theory. It has no rest mass and always propagates at the speed of light. Kinetons interact rhythmically to form higher-order structures such as particles and fields.

---

## ❓ If kinetons move at light speed, how can mass emerge?
Mass is not a property of individual kinetons but of their **structured coherence**. When kinetons form stable, localized rhythmic configurations, the result is perceived as mass.

---

## ❓ What replaces spacetime in this theory?
Instead of relying on a spacetime background, Kineton Theory uses **structural reference frameworks** built from rhythmic densities and their mappings. Space and time are emergent properties of these relationships.

---

## ❓ Why redefine time and motion?
In Kineton Theory:
- **Time** is defined as a partial ordering of rhythmic events
- **Motion** is the ratio of rhythmic densities between structures

This allows for a completely relative and background-free description of dynamics.

---

## ❓ Is relativity still valid in Kineton Theory?
Yes—but it is **derived** rather than assumed. Relativistic behavior (like light speed invariance and Lorentz transformations) emerge naturally from the symmetry of structural mappings.

---

## ❓ Does this theory contradict quantum mechanics or general relativity?
Not necessarily. Kineton Theory aims to **reconstruct** both from a deeper foundation. It is not intended to negate existing models, but to unify them under a rhythm-based structural ontology.

---

## ❓ How does gravity appear in this framework?
Gravitational effects arise from non-uniformities in the **rhythmic density tensor** \( \rho_{\mu\nu} \). These structural gradients replace the curvature of spacetime in general relativity.

---

## ❓ What is the role of the rhythmic density tensor?
It encodes all structural variations that would traditionally be attributed to force, acceleration, or curvature. It serves as the primary geometric object in the theory.

---

## ❓ Is this theory experimentally testable?
While still in its conceptual stage, Kineton Theory suggests possible reinterpretations of existing experiments and might guide future tests once the mathematics are fully developed.
