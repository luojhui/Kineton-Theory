# Mathematical Formulation of Kineton Theory

Kineton Theory proposes that the structure of physical reality arises from rhythmic interactions among massless units called **kinetons**. This document introduces the foundational mathematical quantities and structures used to describe these interactions.

## 1. Rhythmic Density and Motion

Let `ρ_A` and `ρ_B` represent the rhythmic densities of two reference structures A and B, respectively. These densities represent the number of rhythmic events per structural unit.

### Velocity as a Rhythmic Mapping Ratio

We define relative velocity structurally as:

```
v_{A → B} = ρ_A / ρ_B
```

This replaces the classical notion of velocity as displacement over time.

## 2. Rhythmic Density Tensor `ρ_{μν}`

To express acceleration, gravitation, and other field effects, we introduce the **rhythmic density tensor**:

```
ρ_{μν} := variation of rhythmic density under structural transformations
```

### Interpretations:
- Encodes deformation of rhythmic networks
- Analogous to the metric tensor in general relativity, but background-independent
- Structural curvature is the source of perceived forces

## 3. Structural Time

Time is defined as a **partial ordering** of rhythmic events:
- Each event is a local rhythmic configuration
- Causality arises from dependencies in rhythm structure

---

## 4. Structural Relativity Principle

Relativistic invariance becomes a consequence of structural symmetry:

```
L(ρ_{μν}) = L'(ρ'_{αβ})
```

If `ρ_{μν} → ρ'_{αβ}` under valid mapping `M`, the physical laws `L` remain invariant.

## 5. Open Mathematical Questions

- Can rhythmic tensor evolution yield a dynamic theory?
- What algebra governs structural mappings?
- Is there a variational principle for rhythm-based geometries?

This formulation provides the first mathematical layer of Kineton Theory. Further developments will refine these concepts into a consistent formal system.
