# Contributing to Kineton Theory

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the development of **Kineton Theory**, a structural approach to fundamental physics that aims to redefine mass, motion, and time through rhythm-based interactions.

We welcome contributions across conceptual, mathematical, linguistic, and philosophical dimensions.

## 📘 How to Contribute

### 💡 1. Conceptual Suggestions
- Share critiques, questions, or proposals via [Issues](https://github.com/luojhui/Kineton-Theory/issues)
- Help clarify or challenge fundamental assumptions
- Propose alternative interpretations of rhythmic density, motion, or structure

### 📐 2. Mathematical Formalization
- Develop or refine definitions of rhythmic density tensor, structural mappings, or dynamic equations
- Suggest connections to existing mathematical frameworks (e.g., differential geometry, category theory)

### 🔤 3. Language System & Symbolic Structures
- Propose clear and expressive symbolic systems for describing kineton configurations
- Suggest notational standards for future publication

### 🌐 4. Documentation & Communication
- Improve or expand Markdown files under the `docs/` directory
- Suggest diagrams, illustrations, or visual metaphors for key concepts

### 🧪 5. Experiments or Simulations (Future)
- If simulations are added, contribute code, visualization tools, or experimental models
